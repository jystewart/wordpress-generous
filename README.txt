on your wordpress blog. It is compatible with Wordpress versions 2.8+

To use this plugin you will need an account on Generous - a website that

== Installing the plugin

To install the plugin you will need to upload it to the wp-content/plugins 
folder on your server and activate it. If you need help with that, you can
consult Wordpress' documentation at http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins

Once installed go to the widgets admin page and drop "Generous Actions" in
the relevant sidebar. For more on that see http://codex.wordpress.org/Widgets_SubPanel

You'll be prompted to enter your profile URL (see above) and to decide
whether you want to use our styling or to display without styling. The default
is to use our styling, but you can turn it off if you want more control.
